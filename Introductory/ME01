We got a base64 decode which is : VGhlIGZsYWcgeW91IGFyZSBsb29raW5nIGZvciBpcyBFbmMwZDNyTWE0NHQzcg==
We got a hint about how to decode it : CyberChef

First, search in google about CyberChef.
Then, type magic and drag it to the recipe.
Finally , copy the base64 decode and paste it to see what happens. The output i got is :

The flag you are looking for is Enc0d3rMa44t3r
