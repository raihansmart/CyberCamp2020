I got the encoded message : MJZGS43UN5WCAY3JOR4SAZDPMNVXG===

It is base32 encoded. How to decode it?
First, search cyberchef on the internet.
Then, search magic in cyberchef and drag it to the recipe.
Finally, copy and paste the encoded message to see the output, and you got the flag...

Flag : bristol city docks
