I got the code : X_pb_cdi_p_hpaps
I got the hint : Your answer is alphanumeric, but also contains underscores.

After i figured it for around 1 hour+, the code is caesar cipher.

Then after i figured the code is caesar cipher, i search the keyword "caesar cipher decode" in the internet.
And i found this link : https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher
Next, i copy the code and paste it to the "CAESAR SHIFTED CIPHERTEXT" and decrypt it.
The hint is : Your answer is alphanumeric, but also contains underscores.
After i decrypt it, finally i found the flag : I_am_not_a_salad.
