Let's download the zip file from the link : https://cgames-files.allyourbases.co/nm01.zip

Extract the file using unzip (name of the file) command -> unzip nm01.zip

After the file has been extracted, it turns out that the file is a nm01.pcapng file.
Let's open the nm01.pcapng file using wireshark.

Next, while you checking these packet capture there is something interesting in number 4.
In your wireshark let's click Analyze in your menu bar -> Follow -> TCP Stream or Right Mouse -> Follow -> TCP Stream to see what nm01.pcapng is communciating with...

In TCP Stream 0 , i found an interesting output, here is the output :

Todays file password is: SecurePa55word8!

It turns out that SecurePa55word8! is the password... 
Hmmm interesting, it turns out that this file originally is not just .pcapng file.
It may be 7zip / winrar / anything related to it because the file is password-protected.

After i thinking around...... for less than 3 days... 
In the morning, i got the idea about using binwalk to analyze the file for embedded file, and maybe extracting the file itself...

So, i use binwalk (name of the file) command -> binwak nm01.pcapng to see what happens. Here is the output i got :

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3122          0xC32           7-zip archive data, version 0.4

AHA, just i thought before, this file originally is 7-zip file itself.
Let's extract it again this time using 7z e (name of the file) command -> 7z e nm01.pcapng to see what happens. Here is the output i got :

7-Zip [64] 16.02 : Copyright (c) 1999-2016 Igor Pavlov : 2016-05-21

Scanning the drive for archives:

Extracting archive: nm01.pcapng

Enter password (will not be echoed):

The file is password-protected, just i said before... Lets just using enter in your keyboard to see what happens...

ERROR: Data Error in encrypted file. Wrong password? : FLAG/Flag.txt

Sub items Errors: 1

Archives with Errors: 1

Warnings: 1

Sub items Errors: 1

It turns out that if i input the correct password, it will get the output Flag.txt itself.

So, let's input the password i got (SecurePa55word8!) to see what happens after this.

Everything is Ok      

Archives with Warnings: 1

Warnings: 1
Folders: 1

Size:       26

It turns out that we finally input the correct password for the nm01.pcapng (7zip) file itself.

Finally, Let's use ls command to list the file and use cat (name of the file) command -> cat Flag.txt to get the flag....
