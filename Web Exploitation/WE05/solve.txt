Cat. Hat. Donut!

Welcome to my blog!

This is the first entry on my new blog, exciting! So, I bet you'd like to know what it's all about?

Well, if you haven't guessed from the title or my cute logo, it's quite simply about my cats and my love of cooking, mainly pastries, cakes and especially donuts.

I aim to make at least 1 batch a week and show them on here. The trickiest part about all this is I'm learning to make a new website too. It's not as easy as it seems.

Anyway, there's a batch in the oven now I need to get out so must go, but trust me, this is going to be the best blog period
