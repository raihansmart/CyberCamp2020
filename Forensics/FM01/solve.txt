Let's open the link trafficdisruptors.com to see what happens. 
Here is the output i got : This site canâ€™t be reached

Hmm nothing intersting, but how about using dnsdumpster or dig command to increase the curiousity?
Let's use it....

DNS Dumpster Path :
1. Search the internet about "dns dumpster" and you should get the link dnsdumpster.com as a result, open that link...
2. After that, just copy the trafficdisruptors.com and paste it to dnsdumpster and click search. Let's see what happens after this...
3. There is a txt records found in trafficdisruptors.com and there is a flag inside of the txt file itself. Finally, you got the flag for it....

Dig Path :
1. If you don't have installed the dig into your kali linux / ubuntu / parrot linux / anything related to it, you can access the link below to install dig :
https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-dig-command-not-found-install-digonubuntu/
2. If you have installed the dig, you can use dig -h to know more about this command. Alright, let's do it...
3. While you use the dig -h, you see something interesting like this :

 q-type   is one of (a,any,mx,ns,soa,hinfo,axfr,txt,...) [default:a]
                 (Use ixfr=version for type ixfr)
It turns out that dig command can dig the information about the site's txt or anything as long as you input the specified q-type of it...

4. In this case, i use dig (domain site) (q-type) command -> dig trafficdisruptors.com txt to see what happens. Here is the output i got :

; <<>> DiG 9.16.1-Ubuntu <<>> trafficdisruptors.com txt

Finally, you got the flag in the txt file of the trafficdisruptors.com itself...
