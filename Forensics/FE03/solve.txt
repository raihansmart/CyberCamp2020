Let's download the zip file in the link : https://cgames-files.allyourbases.co/fe03.zip
Then, extract the zip file using unzip. Here is the output of the extracted file : REPORT-junior-taking-too-long-at-lunch.pdf

After that, open the extracted file, and you should see that there is a cencored word in the odf itself.
The solution for this is just copy all the text in pdf file, and paste it to your text editor itself. The cencored word should be now UNCENCORED.

Finally, you got the flag which should be in the EOL (End of Lunch) Indicator section. Pretty simple right :)
